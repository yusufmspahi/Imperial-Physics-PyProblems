# Imperial Physics PyProblems 

`PyProblems` is a new initiative developed in the **Imperial College Department of Physics** that aims to provide students with additional, extracurricular opportunities to develop their Python simulation and problem-solving skills. These exercises are based on the content covered by the 1st and 2nd-year Physics curriculum and aim to simultaneously reinforce the understanding of Physics concepts.

This repository contains both the problems and my solutions to the [Imperial Physics PyProblems](https://pyproblems.github.io/book/intro.html) in Jupyter Notebook form, listed by the course to which they are relevant.
