# Imperial Physics PyProblems

This repository contains my solutions to the Imperial computational physics problems ([Imperial Physics PyProblems](https://pyproblems.github.io/book/intro.html)). 

`PyProblems` is a new initiative developed in the Imperial College Department of Physics that aims to provide students with additional, extracurricular opportunities to develop their Python simulation and problem-solving skills. These exercises are based on the content covered by the 1st and 2nd-year Physics curriculum and so aim to help reinforce the understanding of Physics concepts simultaneously.

Here you will find both problems and solutions in Jupyter notebook form, listed by the course to which they are relevant.
